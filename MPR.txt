Margin Period of Risk:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Even with daily margin call frequency, there is a significant delay δ t , known as the margin period of risk (MPR), 
between a margin call that the counterparty does not respond to and the closeout/replacement of the portfolio if 
the counterparty defaults.
  – Margin calls can be disputed, and it may take several days for the bank
    to realize that the counterparty is defaulting rather than disputing the call
  – There is a grace period after the bank issues notice of default.
    During this grace period the counterparty may still post collateral
  – It may take time to close out and replace complex trades

While δ t is not known with certainty, it is usually assumed to be a fixed number, specified at the margin agreement level.
– Assumed value of δ t depends on margin call frequency and trade liquidity
– Typical assumption for daily calls and liquid trades is δ t = 2 weeks(DEFAULT MPR 10 days)

Including MPR in the Model:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Suppose that at time t − δ t we have collateral C(t − δ t) and portfolio value is V(t − δ t)
  Then, the amount ΔC(t) that should be posted by time t is
    ΔC (t ) = max {V (t −δ t ) − C (t −δ t ) − cptyThreshold, −C(t −δ t )}
    Negative ΔC(t) means that collateral will be returned

  Collateral C(t) available at time t is
    C (t ) = C (t − δ t ) + ΔC (t ) = max {V (t − δ t ) − cptyThreshold ,0}

  For comparison, collateral under the “naive” model is
    C_naive (t ) = max {V (t ) − cptyThreshold ,0}

  Thus, to determine collateralized exposure at time t ,
  we need to simulate portfolio value both at t − δ t and at t .

MPR calc is driven by various measures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Collateral disputes.
Hard to replace
Liquity of underlying assets
etc..

We can look to pick one of the measure, which is Liquidity of the underlying assets.
This is something that has been picked recently by requlators and the banks have looked to implement it into their models.

As part of latest Basel-3 requirement Trades secured with posted collaterals or an OTC derivative that cannot be easily replaced, a supervisory floor of 20 business daysis imposed for margin period of risk.
The Objective is to identify all Held collaterals(with its underlying securities) and tag them as illiquid / Liquid based on a defined classification criteria.
The reason to follow this exersice is in situations where trades are deemed illiquid but are not marked daily and are subjected to specific accounting treatment for valuation 
purpose.
eg: OTC or REPO transactions referencing securities whose fair value is determined by models with inputs that are not observed in the market.

For our presentation we can look to cover the following products.
-OTC derivative trades
-REPO (repurchase order)
-Stock Lend Borrow
-Central cleared counterparty trades(Exchange trades futures and options)

The Liquid collateral/Trades can be categorised under.
-Cash
-US govt or Agency securities
-G7 and Swiss Govt securities
-Corporate Bonds (-Investment grade US corporate)
				  -Issue(or underlying security rating(Moody, Fitch, SNP) to be considered)
				  -In case of unavailablity of information a defaulting Issuer rating rule applies in categorisation.
-Equity (-will take the exchanges its been trades.
		 -Presence on major indices.
		 -Also consider Held Value of Quity and the Trading Volume.
		 )

Once all securities are tagged as discussed above.

We will have to look at a portfolio, which comprises of the following identifiers.
ie Counterparty + BookingEntity(a banks booking center regionally) + Products(Asset classes) + NettingAgreements(used to net positions, based on a ISDA or legal aggreements)
Lets call them Business area(BA).
Now if under one of underlying security in the trades process for exposure calculation in a BA has Illiquid securities.
The holding periods used in the expsore calculation will be marked to 20 days of supervisory MarginPeriodOfRisk(MPR).
For BA's with only Liquid assets will NOT receive MPR floor of 20 in the calculation.

As an example:
MPR is one of the key parameters in the Exposure calc along with other details confidence-level, stress period window, etc along with the Market factors linked to each trades under each BA(portfolio).
we can even show a BA expsoure calculation data set, with Trades/Sensitivities/HoldingPeriod(20 and non-20) 
and see the difference in exposure calculated.

This exposure number(PotentionalExposure or EffectiveExposure) is inturn used to drive the RiskWeightedAsset
Which is the amount of capital  reserve a financial institution needs to hold.

These exposure number also constitutes to the EAD(exposure at default) calculated against each counterparty.
